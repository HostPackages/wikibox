# Making presentations fun again

**Viewing a Presentation**

The html can be viewed on any mobile or tablet device, too. Attachments can be included with relative links.

**Sharing of Presentations**

Sharing the single html file with css and javascript included makes presentations much more fun. For example ations can now included interactive elements and links to external files.

**Sharing Formats**

Sharing is supposed to be done in one of these ways. 
1. As single .html file.  
2. As a zipped folder. Illustrated below.  

	.
	|-- Presentation.zip
		|-- Presentation Folder
			|-- presentation.html 		// presentation
			|-- presentation.pdf 		// printed presentation
			|-- attachment.pdf 			// other pdfs
			|-- attachment.doc 			// other documents
			|-- attachment.java			// code snippets
